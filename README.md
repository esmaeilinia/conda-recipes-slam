### Install miniconda and add to PATH
Install anaconda if you don't have it (instructions here for OS X)
```sh
wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/anaconda
export PATH=$HOME/anaconda/bin:$PATH
```

### To build packages
Get the newest version of conda, as well as some conda build tools.
```sh
conda update conda -y
conda install conda-build anaconda-client -y
```

Create a new environment, and build all packages.
Both `PYTHONPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` should have been set automatically on environment activation. See activate.sh / deactivate.sh.
```sh
conda create -n slam_env python=2
source activate slam_env
build_all.sh
```

### More useful stuff
```sh
conda install -c asmeurer emacs=24.5
conda install -c menpo eigen=3.2.7
```
